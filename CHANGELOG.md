# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Model reading (Phase 1)
- 16 read-only tools in the `model` toolset: `nwd_list_models`, `nwd_get_document_metadata`, `nwd_peek_file_info`, `nwd_get_scene_bounds`, `nwd_get_item_hierarchy`, `nwd_get_items_geometry`, `nwd_get_visibility_state`, `nwd_describe_properties`, `nwd_property_value_histogram`, `nwd_export_properties_table`, `nwd_get_hyperlinks`, `nwd_get_grids`, `nwd_locate_items_on_grid`, `nwd_get_comments`, `nwd_list_sheets`, `nwd_list_alignments`.
- Item scope accepts `all=true` and `geometry_only=true`.
- Typed property values: numbers stay numbers and named constants show their display name.
- CSV exports go to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Bimwright
wd-mcp\exports`. They are UTF-8 with BOM, neutralise formula injection and take sanitised file names only.
- `scripts/register-tools.py` registers new commands in every catalog, snapshot and README allow list.

### Full-API foundations (Phase 0)
- Plug-in projects for every year reference `Autodesk.Navisworks.Clash`, `Timeliner`, `Takeoff`, `ComApi` and `Interop.ComApi`, ready for the clash, 4D, quantification and user-property tools.
- Fixed: 2022–2024, 2026 and 2027 plug-ins did not compile. They lacked the `IsExternalInit` polyfill and referenced `Autodesk.Navisworks.Api.Controls.dll`, which does not exist; the installed DLL is `Autodesk.Navisworks.Controls.dll`.
- New toolsets `model`, `review`, `review_write`, `sets_write`, `clash`, `clash_write`, `timeliner`, `timeliner_write`, `takeoff`, `takeoff_write`, `data_write`, `export`. All are on by default, and `--read-only` strips the write halves.
- Workflow profiles for `--toolsets`: `core`, `visual`, `coordination`, `4d`, `qto`, `data`. They combine with toolset names.
- Stable item ids: handlers accept `pid:<model>:<pathId>`, `nid:<model>:<id>` and `guid:<guid>` alongside the path form. `id_mode` chooses the emitted form.
- Shared item scope (`item_ids` | `set_id` | `selection="current"`) and offset/limit/cursor paging for list tools.
- New tool `nwd_resolve_ids` (toolset `model`, read-only) converts items to every id form.
- `docs/ADDING_TOOLS.md`: checklist and building blocks for new tools.

### Fixed
- Empty-document camera reads guard `HasFocalDistance` and return `focal_distance: null` instead of throwing.
- Saved viewpoint/set names containing literal `/` now round-trip. Lists retain `name` and add `id` and `path`; consumers accept these identifiers. Escaped paths start with `path:/`, encode `~` as `~0` and `/` within a segment as `~1`. GUID-less SDK items use the escaped path as their ID. Legacy unambiguous names/paths still work; ambiguous names fail rather than silently selecting the first match.
- Active ToolBaker lists exclude accepted/archived/permanently dismissed suggestions and current snoozes. Dismiss persists a UTC deadline exactly 30 days ahead, reports it, and repeated snooze calls do not extend it. Expired snoozes become effectively open without mutating data during a read-only listing. Legacy dismissed rows without a deadline stay hidden.

### Added
- `nwd_health_check` now reports loaded server/plugin runtime identities, versions, build ids and version/revision alignment. Host failure preserves the running server identity; legacy plugins without identity report unknown evidence. Disk hashes are explicitly scoped to identity capture, not loaded memory or publisher verification.
- Optional `check_updates` (offline by default; recommended once at session start) compares both components with one official stable release and tag revision using a shared 5-second budget and bounded responses. Missing evidence/failures remain unknown. Notifications distinguish new releases, revision review, unverified identity, external lookup failure and informational newer local versions. `protected_components`/reasons and separate `unobserved_components` prevent unsafe full-bundle proposals. Only `update_guidance.mode=prepare_update` with `bundle_update_proposal_allowed=true` returns installation steps and requests authorization; other modes only check/report/review. Health never downloads packages, installs, saves/closes documents or restarts anything.
- Full informational version in `initialize.serverInfo`, per-process health tool runtime metadata in `tools/list`, and `client_verification` evidence for reconnect/cache checks. The server cannot itself verify a client catalog refresh. Health remains available in read-only mode; its open-world annotation is true for the optional GitHub lookup. Tool counts and existing no-argument calls are unchanged.
- Version/revision assembly attributes enabled for all six plugin shells, plus runtime, release comparison and stdio protocol regression tests.

## v1.0.1 - 2026-10-02

### Added
- Toast position controls in Status: independent horizontal/vertical alignment for four corners, opt-in title-row dragging, remembered owner-relative DIP offsets and Reset position. Changes apply/save immediately; changing corners clears offsets, disabling drag preserves them. Monitor-work-area clamping, anchored expansion with opposite-side fallback, directional enter/exit and smooth corner changes respect reduced motion. No cross-app collision coordination.
- Latest-tool and activity-row tooltips include sanitized outcome, success/failure, captured completion time and measured duration when available.
- Deliberate-hover activity preview: all outcomes in the current toast card, with tool name, compact result, success/failure and local 24-hour completion time (`HH:mm:ss`). Starts at the newest three compact, individually bordered cards; each shows a title/time line and one ellipsized result line, with the full bounded result in its tooltip. Scroll up through older calls using the thin RVT-style scrollbar. No scroll/refresh instruction footer. Virtualized rows and immutable indexed snapshots keep a growing card compact. Expands with height/fade/slide easing after a 200 ms intent delay and collapses after a short leave grace period. Incoming results append immediately while hovered: follow the latest at the bottom, preserve the scroll position while reading older calls, and resume following when returning to the bottom. A new hover after full collapse starts at the latest; interrupted collapse preserves reading position. One/two-call cards grow without clipping new rows. Independent of branding, reduced-motion aware, no focus stealing or additional call-log persistence. Summaries have bounded text lengths and redact credentials/full paths; raw requests, result JSON and script source are not retained.

### Fixed
- Script failures inside a successful transport envelope now count as Failed instead of Success in the activity card.
- Hide/show, selection and search-set results describe the actual outcome instead of a generic completion. Empty script stdout no longer hides a real result; object/array script results use a bounded summary rather than their raw contents.

## v1.0.0 - 2026-09-30

Client setup ZIP: `NwdMcp.Setup-v1.0.0-win-x64.zip` (self-contained `nwd-mcp.exe`). **Plugin year in this ZIP:** Navisworks Manage **2025**. Source still supports 2022–2027. NuGet `Bimwright.Nwd.Server` 1.0.0 is server-only (no plug-in).

### Changed
- Destructive tools now say what they change and how to undo it: `nwd_open_file` (discarding unsaved changes cannot be undone), `nwd_hide_items`, `nwd_unhide_all`, `nwd_run_baked_tool`, `nwd_dismiss_bake_suggestion`.
- The server instructions end with a **Safety & permissions** paragraph: confirm exact files or items before discarding or changing user files, and do not retry a denied call through a baked tool or `nwd_send_code`.
- The server installs at the fixed path `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Bimwright\nwd-mcp\server\current\nwd-mcp.exe` instead of a versioned folder, matching the other bimwright gateways. Reinstalls swap the whole `current` folder so no stale files remain; earlier `server\<version>` copies are kept and reported — repoint MCP client entries to the new path.

### Added
- Response-size policy on every tool result (rvt-mcp parity, enforced server-side). Over 64 KiB adds a `_response_warning` field to the result JSON (stronger above 256 KiB); past the 1 MiB budget a read tool is rejected with `RESPONSE_TOO_LARGE`, while a completed write returns a compacted success (`ok`, `response_compacted`, `mutation_applied`) instead of a false failure. `nwd_send_code` and `nwd_run_baked_tool` report `mutation_applied: null` when the outcome is indeterminate.
- `output=file` on `nwd_get_model_tree` (JSON), `nwd_batch_get_properties` (SQLite), `nwd_find_items_by_name` (NDJSON) and `nwd_run_baked_tool` (auto-detected format) writes the full result to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Bimwright\nwd-mcp\spill` and returns its path, schema and a preview. `nwd_send_code` output above 1 MiB auto-spills the same way; there is no `output` parameter on it. Spill files are kept 24 hours, capped at 50, and removed on uninstall. A spill that cannot be written reports `SPILL_FAILED` with `operation_completed` rather than pretending the call failed.
- MCP tool annotations on every tool except `nwd_send_code` (`readOnlyHint`, `destructiveHint`, `idempotentHint`, `openWorldHint=false`) for Claude Code's permission auto mode, and Claude Desktop: the 23 read tools can be allowed once, while `nwd_open_file`, `nwd_hide_items`, `nwd_unhide_all`, `nwd_run_baked_tool`, and `nwd_dismiss_bake_suggestion` always ask. README **Permissions & auto mode** has the `permissions.allow` list of the read-only tools and a warning against `mcp__nwd-mcp__*`. **Migration:** no parameters or defaults changed.
- **Record** switch for every tool call, off by default. The ribbon, Status window, `recordCalls` in `nwdmcp.config.json`, and `BIMWRIGHT_NWD_RECORD_CALLS` share it. While on, calls append to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Bimwright\nwd-mcp\mcp-calls.jsonl`. `send_code` stores length and SHA-256 instead of the script.
- `nwd_list_recent_files`, `nwd_open_file`, and `nwd_import_model`. A default launch registers every toolset (33 tools). Open refuses unsaved changes unless `discard_changes` is true. Import `append` adds a model; `merge` combines it. Open and import wait up to 5 minutes.
- Live benchmark of all 33 tools on Navisworks Manage 2025 (duration, result size, estimated tokens, size policy, spill-to-file): `docs/benchmarks/2026-09-30-navisworks-manage-2025.md`.

### Fixed
- Item ids below a model root were empty, so `nwd_get_model_tree`, `nwd_find_items`, `nwd_find_items_by_name`, and `nwd_get_current_selection` returned no usable ids and `nwd_hide_items` / `nwd_get_item_properties` could not target them. Ids now look like `0:0:6:3`, and each parent's children are numbered once per call: on a 10,717-item model, `nwd_get_model_tree` depth 6 / 5,000 nodes takes ~0.1 s and `nwd_find_items_by_name` 500 hits ~0.3 s.
- `nwd_get_model_statistics` returns `item_count`, as its description says.
- `nwd_send_code` failed on Navisworks 2025 with `TypeInitializationException` (`PerTypeValues`1`): Navisworks has no binding redirects for the Roslyn dependencies we ship. The plug-in now resolves those assemblies from its own folder. Scripts also ran on a worker thread, where the Navisworks API is not valid; they now compile off the UI thread and run on it, return the last expression as `result`, and report the full exception chain.
- A command that waited in the UI queue past the caller's timeout still ran, and long walks kept Navisworks busy after the caller gave up. Stale commands are now skipped with `TIMEOUT`, and `get_model_tree`, `find_items`, `find_items_by_name`, `batch_get_properties`, and `get_model_statistics` stop at the deadline and mark the result (`truncated: "deadline"`, `item_count_complete: false`).
- The target descriptor always reported no document: the heartbeat read the document off the UI thread. The title and path are now read on the UI thread after each command and on idle.
- When the 10 MB plug-in wire cap rejects a write command's reply, the error now says the command already ran and not to blindly retry it; the generic narrowing hint no longer names specific parameters.
- Failed tool calls (`{"ok":false,...}`) now also set the MCP `isError` flag.
- The server enforces `maxResponseBytes` on plug-in replies, and tool results are compact JSON (about half the size of the previous indented output).
- `contains`, `startsWith`, and `endsWith` filters in `nwd_find_items` and `nwd_select_items_by_search` matched nothing. They now match, case-insensitive.
- A command that reached the plug-in before a UI `SynchronizationContext` was captured ran on a worker thread and could crash Navisworks (0x80131509). It now falls back to the UI `Dispatcher` (PR #1 by @huangting2015).

## v0.1.2 - First GitHub Release

Client setup ZIP: `NwdMcp.Setup-v0.1.2-win-x64.zip` (self-contained `nwd-mcp.exe`). **Plugin year in this ZIP:** Navisworks Manage **2025** (the only Manage install on the pack machine). Source still supports 2022–2027.

### Fixed

- Navisworks 2025 API compatibility for model-tree walk and the host gate.
- Tool dispatch hardened before the public push.

### Changed

- Plugin handlers marked verified against a live Navisworks Manage session (supersedes the v0.1.1 “not live-tested” status line).
- README Install section, locale links, tool counts, and path-sanitization scope.
- Japanese and Simplified Chinese README mirrors.

## v0.1.1 - Handler Layer Completion

### Added
- **Unified ModelItem ID encoding** (`ModelItemHelper.cs`) using deterministic index-path scheme (`modelIndex:childIndex:...`) shared by every handler that produces or consumes item IDs.
- **10 plug-in handlers fully implemented** with real Navisworks .NET API calls:
  `hide_items`, `unhide_all`, `select_items_by_search`, `save_viewpoint`, `goto_viewpoint`,
  `list_viewpoints`, `get_current_viewpoint`, `list_sets`, `get_selection_set_items`, `execute_search_set`.
- **6 existing read handlers updated** to produce/consume consistent ModelItem IDs:
  `find_items`, `find_items_by_name`, `get_model_tree`, `get_item_properties`, `batch_get_properties`, `get_current_selection`.
- `walkthrough.md` documenting what is verified and what awaits live Navisworks testing.

### Changed
- `README.md` — Added "Current Status" section with honest plug-in verification status.

### Fixed
- Resolved all 6 nullable-reference warnings (`ToolCompiler.cs`, `AcceptBakeSuggestionHandler.cs`); the server now builds warning-clean in Debug and Release.
- Extracted the duplicated Navisworks search-filter logic into a shared `SearchConditionBuilder` (used by `find_items` and `select_items_by_search`).

### Removed
- `UnitTest1.cs` — Empty test template file.

### Status
- Server: 0 warnings, 0 errors (Debug + Release).
- Tests: 40 xUnit tests, all passing.
- **Plug-in handlers are written but not compiled/tested against a live Navisworks instance.**
